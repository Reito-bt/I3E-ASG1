# Intro to the game
You have been cornered in a small room and your only objective is to get out alive 

# How to play
Use WASD to move around, use mouse to look around, press shift to run, spacebar to jump, E to interact with objects like coins, keys, doors and car. Finally use F to shoot. 

# Goal of the game
Kill all the enemies, collect the coins and extract using the car 

# Platform supported
Windows low to high end computers are able to run it

# Bugs 
The score UI at the end - when the player interacts with the car and the ending UI shows up - the total score doesnt reflect correctly with the actual score on the top right of the screen. The laser doesnt do damage to the player when the player stands on top of it 

# Answer Key

Player starts in an inclosed room where they need to collect the green key to unlock the green door and they can also collect the coin in between the two lasers. After player opens the door, they are met with enemies that will shoot the player when the player is in range of them. The player will shoot the enemies and eliminate them before collecting all the coins. Afterwards, the player can do the obstacle course to reach the grey truck. The player must jump and press E on the truck in order to load the End Screen UI and end the game
